Yup, it's a fake unix shell with a few basic commands provided.
Compile it with mcs or whatever official microsoft compiler is available,
then call it from a terminal or commandline to interact with it through a captive
user interface.

This was made mostly out of curiosity, but should be portable enough to plug into a GUI inside a game framework like Godot or Unity3D.

## Commands

- clear
- ls
- cd
- exit
- pwd
- rm
- touch
- mkdir
- cat
- echo
- grep

## Development

With the implementation of piping, this tiny project is finished.
